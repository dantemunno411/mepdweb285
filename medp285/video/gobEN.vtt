00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
It's the summer of 2020, and I haven't seen my friends in six months.
Because of Covid-19 we all had to social distance and quarantine.



3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:12.000
I was stuck at home with literally nothing to do so I played cards by myself.
(Don't ask me how but I ended up losing...)



5
00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.000
I tried to pick up an instrument.

6
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.000
But it was at that point when I realized that I wasn't musically gifted. :(

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.000
My friend finally message me to go and hang out at a farm for his birthday.
So I began to workout to impress them with my new quarantine body. 

8
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.000
I could only do three pull ups... :(

9
00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.000
It's time to show off my new found strength!

10
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.000
...I missed.

11
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.000
It's okay we all deserve a second chance!

12
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:36.000
(What a weakling)

13
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:46.000
After embarrassing myself in-front of my friends we decided to try the corn field maze.

14
00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:53.000
WOW! Look at this view! :o

15
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.000
I forgot how it felt to enjoy the company of another person.

16
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.000 
Thanks for watching!
